# ML-Project-Proposal

I have written this proposal upon your request for detailed expanation and working of proposed project. There are two project tracks:

- **Analysis**: derive insights from a dataset, and generate a professional and
polished report. Deliverable can be a writeup (e.g. whitepaper, blog series) or
presentation (slides and preferably recorded video), or both.
- **Engineering**: build a system that processes data using ML approaches and
exposes the results as an API to facilitate applications. Deliverable is a
deployed and documented API web service, with a simple demo app as part of the
documentation.

An example of the analysis track would be to use data about bike sharing systems
to summarize their usage patterns, social and transit impact, and predict what
the future may hold for them and what cities they will do well or poorly in.
Generating visualizations that portray data geographically would be a great way
to make this particular project stand out.

An example of the engineering track would be to use data about movies to build a
recommender system that accepts as input some information about movies a user
likes or dislikes, and returns as output more movies they may like. As a stretch
goal it could offer a variety of strategies or approaches to recommendations,
and by default use an ensemble technique to blend them.

Keeping in view our needs and the end deliverables you need i have found engineering tracks to be appropriate for your project - however both the paths will entail
similar ML techniques, but the end result and a fair amount of time
investment will be different.

Now that i have chosen track, my next task to focus attention is to get data. Choosing, obtaining,
and cleaning the data is all part of the project, and i may have to try a few
samples of datasets before one really works for desired requirements.

The dataset that you will be providing will shape the techniques that will be available and applicable. Key questions i will be considering regarding the dataset wil be:

- How clean and consistent is data?
  - Does it have missing values I might have to impute?
  - Are there outliers, weird strings, unexpected types, or other warning signs?
  - Was it gathered/sampled in a way representative of the true population?
- What are the fundamental types of required variables?
  - Do I have numeric/continuous values (e.g. money)?
  - Do I have ordinal values (e.g. rating scales)?
  - Do I have categorical values (e.g. product type)?
- How structured is the data?
  - Is it labeled (for the qualities we're interested in) or unlabeled?
  - Is there one or more dependent variables (something we want to predict)?
  - What are the independent variables (values we want to predict with)?

This is where I will need
to think back over the many techniques that i have covered and pick the appropriate
tools to handle the problem at hand, most considerably Tensorflow.
